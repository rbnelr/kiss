implement type deducing print function with nice printf-style format string
- AFAIK in c++ variadic functions can either be:
 - C varargs -> don't know about types, no go
 - variadic templates, IIRC there is way to turn a variable number of arguments into an array via wrapper function
  -> templates are horrible though
 - just autogenerate a bunch of functions print_1arg, print_2arg, print_3arg and have them prepare a tagged union with copy/ref to vales and pass this to the actual print func
